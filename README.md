![Yelp Logo](https://logos-world.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Yelp-Logo.png)

## üìä Overview

Yelp is a company that provides crowdsourced reviews and online reservation services for local businesses. It was founded in 2004 by former PayPal employees. Yelp allows users to rate and review various types of local businesses on its platform, including restaurants, cafes, hotels, shops, and more. Users can use Yelp to explore others‚Äô opinions and reviews, helping them make more informed consumption decisions.

The Yelp review dataset is a rich collection of review information gathered from the Yelp platform, including ratings, review texts, user information, and business information. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into user opinions on various business types, uncover valuable patterns such as user preferences and business strengths or weaknesses, and provide targeted advice and recommendations to local businesses and users.

This project aims to analyze the Yelp review dataset to explore trends, patterns, and associations within the data, extracting valuable insights through visualizations, statistical analysis, and network analysis. Through this data analysis, we can gain a deeper understanding of user behavior, business conditions, and social networks within the Yelp review ecosystem, ultimately helping Yelp and its users make better decisions and offer improved services.

## üîç Key Findings

A clear trend emerges: negative reviews tend to be significantly longer than positive ones. Users writing 1-2 star reviews feel compelled to explain their dissatisfaction in detail, while satisfied customers keep their praise concise.

### Monthly Vote Trends

![Vote Trends](screenshots/vote_trends.png)

The analysis of "useful," "funny," and "cool" votes shows:
- "Useful" votes consistently outpace other categories
- All vote types show similar seasonal patterns
- Peak voting activity occurred in 2016-2017
- Steady growth over time with occasional spikes

- Stuttgart and Edinburgh display organic, irregular distributions reflecting centuries of historical growth

## üí≠ Sentiment Analysis & Review Mining

### Review Sentiment Distribution

![Sentiment Distribution](screenshots/sentiment_distribution.png)

The sentiment analysis of reviews shows:
- A normal distribution centered slightly positive (0.2-0.3 on the sentiment scale)
- Elite Yelp users tend to have more balanced sentiment distribution than regular users
- Most reviews (>60%) have positive sentiment scores
- Extremely negative (-1.0) and extremely positive (1.0) reviews are rare

### Positive vs. Negative Words

![Positive Words](screenshots/positive_words.png)
![Negative Words](screenshots/negative_words.png)

Our word cloud visualization emphasizes:
- Positive reviews predominantly use words like "good," "great," "best," "love," "amazing," and "definitely"
- Negative reviews focus on words like "bad," "problem," "terrible," "worst," "horrible," and "disappointed"
- Emotional intensity and descriptive language are stronger in negative reviews

## ‚è∞ Check-in Patterns

![Check-in Variations](screenshots/checkin_variations.png)

Check-in data reveals predictable patterns:
- Weekends show significantly higher activity
- Peak hours occur between 5-7 PM across all days
- The lowest activity occurs between 2-6 AM
- Each day follows a similar curve with weekend amplification

These patterns provide valuable insights for business scheduling and promotional timing.

## üë§ User Behavior Analysis

### User Engagement Distribution

![User Review Distribution](screenshots/user_review_distribution.png)

User engagement follows a classic power law distribution:
- ~70% of users write only 1-2 reviews
- A small minority of power users contribute disproportionately
- The top reviewer wrote 3,569 reviews, while the median user writes just 1

This insight helps understand platform dynamics and identify influential users.

Using the AFINN sentiment lexicon, we quantified the contribution of each word to overall review sentiment:
- The word "great" has the highest positive sentiment contribution across all reviews
- "Bad" has the strongest negative sentiment contribution
- Words like "amazing," "awesome," and "best" are powerful drivers of positive sentiment
- Negative sentiment is often driven by words like "terrible," "disappointed," and "worst"

### Top User Sentiment Patterns

Through review mining, we identified patterns in how top contributors express sentiment:
- The top 10 most active reviewers show more balanced sentiment than average users
- Elite users typically provide more nuanced feedback with specific details
- Regular users tend toward more polarized sentiment (either very positive or very negative)
- Users with higher review counts tend to use more moderate language
